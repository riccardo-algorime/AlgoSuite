# Test Coverage Assessment

## Test Structure

The application's tests are organized in the `backend/tests` directory with the following structure:

- `api/`: API endpoint tests
- `schemas/`: Schema validation tests
- `conftest.py`: Pytest fixtures and configuration
- `mocks.py`: Mock objects for testing

## API Tests

The API tests cover the following endpoints:

### Covered Endpoints

- **Projects**
    - `test_projects.py`: Tests for project endpoints
    - `test_get_project.py`: Tests for getting a specific project
    - `test_project_attack_surfaces.py`: Tests for project attack surfaces endpoints
    - `test_get_project_attack_surface.py`: Tests for getting a specific project attack surface

- **Health Check**
    - `test_health.py`: Tests for health check endpoint

- **Users**
    - `test_users_api.py`: Tests for user endpoints

### Missing API Tests

The following endpoints do not have dedicated test files:

- Authentication endpoints (`/api/v1/auth/*`)
- Registration endpoint (`/api/v1/register`)
- Asset endpoints (`/api/v1/projects/{project_id}/attack-surfaces/{attack_surface_id}/assets/*`)
- Scan endpoints (`/api/v1/scans/*`)

## Schema Tests

The schema tests cover the following schemas:

### Covered Schemas

- **Project Schemas**
    - `test_project_schemas.py`: Tests for project schemas

### Missing Schema Tests

The following schemas do not have dedicated test files:

- User schemas
- Token schemas
- Scan schemas
- Attack Surface schemas
- Asset schemas
- Health Check schemas

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Unit Test Coverage

- **Models**: No dedicated unit tests for database models
- **Services**: No dedicated unit tests for service classes
- **Utilities**: No dedicated unit tests for utility functions

### Integration Test Coverage

- **API Endpoints**: Partial coverage (projects, health check, users)
- **Database Operations**: Limited coverage through API tests
- **Authentication**: No dedicated tests

### End-to-End Test Coverage

- No end-to-end tests identified

## Test Fixtures

The application uses pytest fixtures defined in `conftest.py` for:

- Database setup and teardown
- Test client creation
- Authentication token generation
- Test data creation

## Mock Objects

The application uses mock objects defined in `mocks.py` for:

- Mocking external dependencies
- Creating test data

## Coverage Gaps

### Critical Gaps

1. **Authentication and Authorization**: No tests for authentication endpoints or authorization mechanisms
2. **Service Layer**: No unit tests for business logic in service classes
3. **Error Handling**: Limited testing of error conditions and edge cases
4. **Asset Management**: No tests for asset endpoints
5. **Scanning Functionality**: No tests for scan endpoints or background tasks

### Recommended Test Additions

1. **Authentication Tests**:
    - Login endpoint tests
    - Token refresh tests
    - Authentication failure tests
    - Permission tests

2. **Service Unit Tests**:
    - Security service tests
    - User service tests
    - Business logic tests

3. **Schema Validation Tests**:
    - Tests for all Pydantic schemas
    - Edge case validation tests

4. **Asset and Scan Tests**:
    - CRUD tests for assets
    - Scan execution tests
    - Scan result tests

5. **Error Handling Tests**:
    - Tests for expected error responses
    - Tests for edge cases and invalid inputs

## Test Quality Assessment

### Strengths

- Tests are organized by feature area
- Pytest fixtures are used for test setup
- API tests cover basic functionality for some endpoints

### Weaknesses

- Limited coverage of API endpoints
- No unit tests for business logic
- Limited testing of error conditions
- No performance or load tests
- No security-specific tests

## Recommendations for Improving Test Coverage

1. Implement unit tests for all service classes
2. Add tests for all API endpoints
3. Create tests for all schema validations
4. Add tests for error conditions and edge cases
5. Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows
6. Add performance tests for critical operations
7. Implement security-specific tests (authentication, authorization)
8. Set up test coverage reporting to track improvements
