# Database Access Strategy for NestJS Migration

## ORM Evaluation

### TypeORM

**Strengths:**

- Native TypeScript support with strong typing
- Similar to SQLAlchemy in terms of entity definition and repository pattern
- Supports all major relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.)
- Supports both Active Record and Data Mapper patterns
- Comprehensive migration system
- Supports complex relationships (one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many)
- Supports UUID primary keys
- Supports timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
- Good integration with NestJS through @nestjs/typeorm

**Weaknesses:**

- Learning curve for developers new to TypeORM
- Some issues with complex queries and performance in very large applications
- Migration system is not as mature as Alembic

### Prisma

**Strengths:**

- Modern, type-safe ORM with excellent TypeScript integration
- Auto-generated client based on schema
- Powerful schema definition language
- Strong validation and type safety
- Excellent developer experience with Prisma Studio
- Good performance characteristics
- Supports all major relational databases
- Migrations system built-in

**Weaknesses:**

- Less flexible than TypeORM for complex custom queries
- Newer than TypeORM, so community resources may be more limited
- Requires a separate schema file rather than using TypeScript classes
- Integration with NestJS requires more setup than TypeORM

### Mongoose

**Strengths:**

- Excellent for MongoDB
- Schema-based solution for modeling application data
- Built-in type casting, validation, query building
- Middleware support
- Good integration with NestJS through @nestjs/mongoose

**Weaknesses:**

- Only works with MongoDB, not suitable for relational databases
- Not appropriate for the current project which uses a SQL database with complex relationships

## ORM Selection

Based on the current architecture using SQLAlchemy with a relational database and considering the complex relationships
between entities, **TypeORM** is the recommended ORM for this migration for the following reasons:

1. **Similarity to SQLAlchemy**: TypeORM's approach is conceptually similar to SQLAlchemy, making the migration more
   straightforward.
2. **Support for complex relationships**: TypeORM fully supports all the relationship types used in the current models (
   one-to-many, many-to-one, one-to-one, many-to-many).
3. **Native TypeScript support**: TypeORM is designed for TypeScript, providing strong typing and good integration with
   NestJS.
4. **Migration system**: TypeORM includes a migration system that can replace Alembic.
5. **Repository pattern**: TypeORM's repository pattern aligns well with NestJS's service-oriented architecture.

Mongoose is not suitable as it only works with MongoDB, and the current system uses a relational database. While Prisma
is an excellent modern ORM, TypeORM's similarity to SQLAlchemy and better integration with NestJS makes it more suitable
for this migration.

## Database Schema Migration Strategy

1. **Entity Definition**:
    - Create TypeORM entity classes that mirror the current SQLAlchemy models
    - Ensure all relationships are properly defined
    - Implement the same validation rules
    - Set up indexes and constraints as in the current models

2. **Migration Approach**:
    - Use TypeORM's migration system to generate migration scripts
    - Create a baseline migration that represents the current database schema
    - Test migrations in a staging environment before applying to production
    - Maintain backward compatibility during the transition period

3. **Data Migration**:
    - Develop data migration utilities if schema changes are needed
    - Consider using database-native tools for large data migrations
    - Implement validation checks to ensure data integrity after migration

4. **Testing Strategy**:
    - Create comprehensive tests for database operations
    - Verify that all queries produce the same results as in the original system
    - Test edge cases and error conditions

## Database Transaction Handling

1. **Transaction Management**:
    - Use TypeORM's transaction decorators and QueryRunner for complex transactions
    - Implement transaction management in service layers
    - Ensure proper error handling and rollback mechanisms

2. **Implementation Approach**:

   ```typescript
   // Example of transaction handling in a service
   async function createUserWithProject(userData, projectData) {
     const queryRunner = connection.createQueryRunner();

     await queryRunner.connect();
     await queryRunner.startTransaction();

     try {
       // Create user
       const user = new User();
       user.email = userData.email;
       user.fullName = userData.fullName;
       // ... set other properties

       const savedUser = await queryRunner.manager.save(user);

       // Create project
       const project = new Project();
       project.name = projectData.name;
       project.description = projectData.description;
       project.createdBy = savedUser.id;

       await queryRunner.manager.save(project);

       await queryRunner.commitTransaction();

       return savedUser;
     } catch (err) {
       await queryRunner.rollbackTransaction();
       throw new Error(`Transaction failed: ${err.message}`);
     } finally {
       await queryRunner.release();
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Connection Pooling**:
    - Configure connection pooling for optimal performance
    - Set appropriate pool size based on application needs
    - Implement connection timeout and retry mechanisms

4. **Error Handling**:
    - Implement comprehensive error handling for database operations
    - Create custom exception filters for database-related errors
    - Log database errors with appropriate context for debugging

## Conclusion

TypeORM is the recommended ORM for migrating from SQLAlchemy to NestJS due to its similarity to SQLAlchemy, support for
complex relationships, and good integration with NestJS. The migration strategy should focus on creating equivalent
entity definitions, carefully planning schema migrations, and implementing proper transaction handling to ensure data
integrity during and after the migration.
