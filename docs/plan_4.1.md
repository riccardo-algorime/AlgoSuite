# Phase 4.1: Comprehensive Testing Plan

This document details the strategy and actionable steps for Phase 4.1 ("Comprehensive Testing") of the FastAPI to NestJS migration. The goal is to ensure the new NestJS backend is robust, reliable, and production-ready through systematic testing at all levels.

---

## Overview

Comprehensive testing in this phase covers:

- **Unit Testing**: Isolated testing of individual components (services, utilities, DTOs).
- **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between components and with the database.
- **API Testing**: Verifying API contracts, request/response formats, and error handling.
- **Performance Testing**: Measuring and optimizing system performance.
- **Security Testing**: Ensuring the system is secure against common vulnerabilities.

Each testing type is described below with objectives, scope, recommended tools, process, and deliverables.

---

## 1. Unit Testing

### Objectives

- Validate the correctness of individual units (services, helpers, DTOs).
- Ensure business logic is implemented as intended.
- Facilitate refactoring and future development.

### Scope

- All service classes in `nest-backend/src/modules/*/*.service.ts`
- Utility functions in `nest-backend/src/utils/` and `src/common/`
- DTO validation logic

### Tools

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) (already configured)
- [ts-mockito](https://github.com/NagRock/ts-mockito) or [jest-mock](https://jestjs.io/docs/mock-functions) for mocking dependencies

### Process

1. **Identify Units**: List all services, utility functions, and DTOs.
2. **Write Tests**: For each unit:
   - Test all public methods, including edge cases and error conditions.
   - Mock dependencies (e.g., repositories, external services).
   - Verify business logic, state changes, and return values.
3. **Run Tests**: Use `npm run test` or `npx jest`.
4. **Measure Coverage**: Ensure high coverage (target: >90% for core logic).
5. **Document**: Update `docs/test_coverage.md` with coverage reports and test summaries.

### Deliverables

- Test files: `*.spec.ts` alongside or within `test/` directory.
- Coverage reports (HTML/text).
- Documentation of coverage and test approach.

---

## 2. Integration Testing

### Objectives

- Validate interactions between modules, services, and the database.
- Ensure correct data flow and persistence.
- Detect issues in module wiring, dependency injection, and configuration.

### Scope

- Endpoints in `nest-backend/src/modules/*/*.controller.ts`
- Service-to-service interactions
- Database operations (using a test database)

### Tools

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) (integration mode)
- [Supertest](https://github.com/ladjs/supertest) for HTTP requests
- Test database (e.g., PostgreSQL in Docker, SQLite in-memory)

### Process

1. **Set Up Test Environment**:
   - Use a separate test database (see `.env.test`).
   - Run migrations before tests.
2. **Write Integration Tests**:
   - For each controller, test all endpoints (success, failure, edge cases).
   - Test service interactions and data persistence.
   - Use Supertest to simulate HTTP requests.
3. **Tear Down**: Clean up database after each test suite.
4. **Document**: List tested scenarios in `docs/test_coverage.md`.

### Deliverables

- Integration test files: `test/*.e2e-spec.ts`
- Test environment configuration: `.env.test`, `jest-e2e.json`
- Documentation of integration scenarios and results

---

## 3. API Testing

### Objectives

- Ensure API contracts match the original FastAPI implementation.
- Validate request/response formats, status codes, and error handling.
- Confirm API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI) is accurate.

### Scope

- All public API endpoints
- Request/response schemas
- Error responses and edge cases

### Tools

- [Supertest](https://github.com/ladjs/supertest)
- [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) at `/api/docs`
- [Dredd](https://dredd.org/en/latest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) (optional, for contract testing)

### Process

1. **Contract Verification**:
   - Compare NestJS Swagger docs with FastAPI OpenAPI spec.
   - Use Dredd/Postman to automate contract checks if possible.
2. **Write API Tests**:
   - For each endpoint, test valid and invalid requests.
   - Validate response schemas, status codes, and error messages.
   - Test authentication and authorization flows.
3. **Document**:
   - Update API documentation with examples and test results.
   - Note any deviations from the original API.

### Deliverables

- API test scripts (Supertest, Postman collections, or Dredd configs)
- Updated Swagger/OpenAPI docs
- Documentation of API coverage and contract compliance

---

## 4. Performance Testing

### Objectives

- Measure system performance under load.
- Identify and address bottlenecks.
- Ensure the new system meets or exceeds FastAPI performance.

### Scope

- Critical endpoints (e.g., authentication, data retrieval, bulk operations)
- Database-intensive operations

### Tools

- [k6](https://k6.io/), [Artillery](https://artillery.io/), or [JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/)
- Custom scripts for scenario-based load testing

### Process

1. **Define Scenarios**:
   - Identify high-traffic and performance-critical endpoints.
   - Create realistic usage scenarios (concurrent users, data volumes).
2. **Run Load Tests**:
   - Execute tests against staging or test environment.
   - Measure response times, throughput, error rates.
3. **Analyze Results**:
   - Compare with FastAPI benchmarks.
   - Identify slow endpoints and optimize as needed.
4. **Document**:
   - Record performance metrics and optimization steps in `docs/test_coverage.md` or a dedicated performance report.

### Deliverables

- Load test scripts and configuration
- Performance reports (charts, tables)
- Documentation of optimizations and results

---

## 5. Security Testing

### Objectives

- Ensure the system is secure against common vulnerabilities.
- Validate authentication, authorization, and input validation.
- Identify and remediate security risks.

### Scope

- All endpoints and modules
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Input validation and error handling

### Tools

- [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) or [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp)
- [npm audit](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-audit) for dependency checks
- Manual code review

### Process

1. **Automated Scanning**:
   - Run OWASP ZAP/Burp Suite against the running API.
   - Check for vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, CSRF, etc.).
2. **Manual Review**:
   - Review authentication, authorization, and validation logic.
   - Check for sensitive data exposure and error leaks.
3. **Dependency Audit**:
   - Run `npm audit` and address vulnerabilities.
4. **Document**:
   - Record findings, remediation steps, and residual risks in a security report.

### Deliverables

- Security scan reports
- List of vulnerabilities and fixes
- Documentation of security posture and recommendations

---

## Documentation and Reporting

- Update `docs/test_coverage.md` with coverage, scenarios, and results for all testing types.
- Create or update dedicated reports for performance and security testing.
- Ensure all test scripts and configurations are version-controlled.
- Maintain traceability between requirements, tests, and results.

---

## Success Criteria

- All tests (unit, integration, API) pass with high coverage.
- Performance meets or exceeds baseline metrics.
- No critical security vulnerabilities remain.
- Documentation is complete and up-to-date.
