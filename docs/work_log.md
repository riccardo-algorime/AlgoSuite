## Phase 2: Technology Stack Planning

### Task 8: Database access

**Status**: Completed
**Summary**: Evaluated different ORM options (TypeORM, Prisma, Mongoose) and selected the most appropriate one based on
the database type. Documented the migration strategy for the database schema and planned for handling database
transactions.
**Related Files**:

### Task 9: Authentication

**Status**: Completed
**Summary**: Selected appropriate NestJS authentication strategies, planned JWT implementation, documented Passport
integration strategy, and planned for session management.
**Related Files**:

- [authentication_strategy.md](authentication_strategy.md)

### Task 10: Validation

**Status**: Completed
**Summary**: Planned class-validator implementation, documented class-transformer usage, mapped validation pipe
strategy, and planned for custom validators.
**Related Files**:

- [validation_strategy.md](validation_strategy.md)

### Task 11: Documentation

**Status**: Completed
**Summary**: Planned Swagger/OpenAPI integration, documented API versioning strategy, and created a plan for generating
client SDKs. The documentation includes the current implementation, enhancement plans, and an implementation roadmap.
**Related Files**:

### Task 12: Testing

**Status**: Completed
**Summary**: Set up Jest configuration for different test types (unit, integration, and e2e), documented the unit
testing approach with examples, created a comprehensive integration testing strategy, and planned for end-to-end
testing. The documentation includes test coverage goals, continuous integration setup, and testing best practices.
**Related Files**:

- [testing_strategy.md](testing_strategy.md)

### Task 13: Logging and monitoring

**Status**: Completed
**Summary**: Selected Winston as the primary logging library, planned monitoring integration with New Relic and
Prometheus/Grafana, documented a comprehensive error tracking strategy using Sentry, and outlined a performance
monitoring approach with key metrics to track. The documentation includes code examples, best practices, and an
implementation roadmap.
**Related Files**:

- [logging_and_monitoring_strategy.md](logging_and_monitoring_strategy.md)

### Task 16: Define coding standards

**Status**: Completed
**Summary**: Established TypeScript coding conventions, documented NestJS best practices, created a comprehensive style
guide, and set up a code review process. The documentation includes naming conventions, file organization, module
structure, dependency injection patterns, error handling strategies, and version control practices.
**Related Files**:

- [coding_standards.md](coding_standards.md)

## Phase 2: Initial Setup

### Task 17: Initialize NestJS project

**Status**: Completed
**Summary**: Initialized a new NestJS project with the necessary configuration. Created the project structure with
appropriate directories and files. Set up module organization with a modular architecture. Configured project metadata
in package.json and other configuration files. The implementation includes a basic application structure with a root
module, controller, and service, as well as an example feature module (users) to demonstrate the module organization.
