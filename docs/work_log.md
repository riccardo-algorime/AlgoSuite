consistent code formatting with rules for quotes, spacing, line length, and other style preferences. Configured
pre-commit hooks using Husky and lint-staged to automatically run linting and formatting on staged files before commits.
Created a detailed code style guide documenting TypeScript coding conventions, NestJS best practices, formatting rules,
and the code review process.
