# Database Optimization and Security Improvements

This document outlines the changes made to optimize and secure the database and related services in the Docker
environment.

## Changes Made

### Database Service (PostgreSQL with pgvector)

1. **Security Improvements**:
    - Removed direct port exposure to host (now only accessible within Docker network)
    - Added support for environment variable password configuration
    - Added health checks to ensure service availability

2. **Optimization Improvements**:
    - Pinned PostgreSQL version for stability
    - Added performance tuning parameters:
        - Memory allocation (shared_buffers, work_mem)
        - Query optimization (random_page_cost, effective_io_concurrency)
        - Concurrency settings (max_connections, max_worker_processes)
        - Logging configuration (log_min_duration_statement)
    - Added resource limits to prevent excessive resource consumption

### Redis Service

1. **Security Improvements**:
    - Removed direct port exposure to host (now only accessible within Docker network)
    - Added health checks to ensure service availability

2. **Optimization Improvements**:
    - Pinned Redis version for stability
    - Added performance tuning parameters:
        - Memory management (maxmemory, maxmemory-policy)
        - Data persistence (appendonly, appendfsync)
        - RDB snapshot configuration (save)
    - Added resource limits to prevent excessive resource consumption

### Backend and Celery Worker Services

1. **Security Improvements**:
    - Updated to use environment variables for sensitive information
    - Added dependency conditions to ensure services start in the correct order

2. **Reliability Improvements**:
    - Added restart policies
    - Added resource limits to prevent excessive resource consumption

### Frontend Service

1. **Reliability Improvements**:
    - Added restart policy
    - Added dependency condition to ensure backend is available
    - Added resource limits to prevent excessive resource consumption

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be set to customize the deployment:

- `DB_PASSWORD`: PostgreSQL database password (default: "postgres")
- `SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for backend service (default: "development_secret_key")
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key (default: "sk-dummy-key-for-development-only")

## Usage

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your environment variables:
   ```
   DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
   SECRET_KEY=your_secure_secret_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

2. Start the services:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Monitor the services:
   ```
   docker-compose ps
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

4. Test the database connection:
   ```
   # Install required packages if not already installed
   pip install sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary

   # Run the test script
   python test_db_connection.py
   ```

   The test script will attempt to connect to the database and verify that it's working correctly. It will also list the
   tables in the database to confirm that the schema is intact.

## Recommendations for Further Improvements

1. **Database Backups**: Implement regular database backups
2. **Connection Pooling**: Consider adding PgBouncer for connection pooling
3. **Monitoring**: Add monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana
4. **SSL**: Configure SSL for database connections
5. **Secrets Management**: Use Docker secrets or a dedicated secrets management solution
